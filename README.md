ü¶æ3-DOF Robot Arm Design in FreeCAD with Python
This project demonstrates how to model a 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robot arm using Python scripting within FreeCAD. The script is modular, descriptive, and suitable for beginners and intermediate CAD/robotics users aiming to understand programmatic parametric modeling.

üß† Purpose
The goal is to create a simple articulated robot arm composed of:
‚Ä¢	A base with a fixed mount
‚Ä¢	Three articulated links (Link 1, Link 2, Link 3)
‚Ä¢	Rotational joints (J1, J2, J3)
‚Ä¢	A gripper assembly to represent the end-effector
‚Ä¢	Joint markers and axes indicators for visualization
‚Ä¢	Labels for easy identification of joints
This model is primarily useful for educational demonstrations, robot kinematics visualizations, and early-stage design prototyping.

üìÅ File Structure
The repository includes:
‚Ä¢	robot_arm_freecad.py: Main script for generating the robot arm geometry.
‚Ä¢	(Optional) preview.png: A screenshot or render of the final robot arm.
‚Ä¢	README.md or this document: Project explanation.

üîß How It Works ‚Äì Component Breakdown
1. Base
A rectangular block that acts as the robot arm‚Äôs foundation. A joint pin (J1) extends upward from the center to anchor Link 1.
base = Part.makeBox(base_width, base_depth, base_height)
2. Link 1
‚Ä¢	A box-shaped link with two cylindrical holes‚Äîone for the base pin (J1) and one to connect to Link 2 via J2.
‚Ä¢	Positioned and rotated at -45¬∞ around the Y-axis to simulate motion.
3. Link 2
‚Ä¢	Similar to Link 1 but rotated 30¬∞ in the opposite direction to illustrate compound joint rotation.
‚Ä¢	Mounted at J2.
4. Link 3 (Gripper Mount)
‚Ä¢	A shorter link serving as the mount for the gripper.
‚Ä¢	Rotated slightly (-10¬∞) for realism and orientation.
5. Gripper
‚Ä¢	Composed of a main body and two rectangular fingers (upper and lower).
‚Ä¢	Designed as a simple two-prong clamp.
6. Joints
‚Ä¢	Cylindrical pins (J1, J2, J3) represent revolute joints.
‚Ä¢	Joint markers (red spheres) and axes (green cylinders) help users understand rotational axes.
7. Annotations
‚Ä¢	Labels (J1, J2, J3) are added to clarify the joint locations.

üß∞ Dependencies
‚Ä¢	FreeCAD (tested with v0.20+)
‚Ä¢	Python (FreeCAD‚Äôs embedded Python console or standalone interpreter with FreeCAD module path added)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script
Option 1: Inside FreeCAD
1.	Open FreeCAD.
2.	Go to the Python console or the Macro editor.
3.	Paste and run the script.
Option 2: From Terminal
Make sure FreeCAD‚Äôs Python environment is correctly set up.
freecadcmd robot_arm_freecad.py

üìê Design Considerations
‚Ä¢	Parametric Modeling: All dimensions (lengths, offsets, rotations) are controlled via variables for easy adjustment.
‚Ä¢	Clear Visual Hierarchy: Color coding and annotations enhance readability.
‚Ä¢	Realistic Constraints: Joint placements and axis orientations mimic real-world robotic arms.


‚úçÔ∏è Customization Tips
You can adapt the script by:
‚Ä¢	Changing joint angles to simulate different postures.
‚Ä¢	Modifying link lengths to test different arm reaches.
‚Ä¢	Adding servos, gears, or sensor placeholders.
‚Ä¢	Exporting parts as .STEP files for mechanical simulation or 3D printing.
